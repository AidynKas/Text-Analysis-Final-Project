In the pursuit of a thorough examination, this study employs a comprehensive and intricate approach, strategically utilizing advanced web scraping techniques to systematically gather and compile a wealth of information from a diverse array of news articles and YouTube comments. The analysis meticulously incorporates the examination of the seven most widely circulated articles sourced from various news media outlets within Kazakhstan, and is supplemented by a quantitative sentiment analysis to precisely gauge the prevailing mood conveyed in these narratives. Furthermore, the qualitative dimension of the study is enriched by delving into the vast repository of YouTube comments, which serves as a rich source of public opinion, offering nuanced insights and perspectives.
